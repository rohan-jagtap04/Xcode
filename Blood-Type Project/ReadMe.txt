This app is made to contact people with similar blood types for blood donations. I attempted to propose this to the Canadian Blood Services, but unfortunately this project did not come to fruition. 

In order to run this project properly on Xcode: From the terminal enter into this file -> Run 'pod install' (I could not include the pods are the file size was extremely large despite compressing it)
